TODO :
Exercise 3.8: Rendering fractals at high zoom levels demands great arithmetic precision.
Implement the same fractal using four dif ferent representations of numbers: complex64, complex128,
big.Float, and big.Rat. (The latter two types are found in the math/big package.
Float uses arbitrary but bounded-precision floating-point; Rat uses unbounde d-precision
rat ional numbers.) How do they compare in performance and memory usage? At what zoom
levels do rendering artifacts become visible?
